# Portfolio Multiproject (UE5) - [Work in Progress]

This repository serves as a **technical laboratory** designed to showcase my proficiency in **Unreal Engine 5** using a **95%+ Native C++** approach. Moving away from heavy Blueprint logic, this project focuses on creating scalable, high-performance architectures and professional-grade game systems.

## 🚀 Technical Focus
As a developer transitioning from **Industrial Systems Programming** (PLC/VBA), my priority is the implementation of robust and maintainable code following Epic Games' best practices and C++ coding standards.

### Current Status: **Phase 1 (Core Foundations)**

## ✅ Completed Milestones
*   **Modular Core Architecture:** A native C++ framework designed to handle multiple game modules, sub-levels, and centralized game-state management.
*   **Splash Screen & Main Menu:** Implementation of professional-grade UI flow using **C++ and UMG** (User Widget).
*   **Native GameInstance & GameMode:** Custom classes to manage persistent data and global logic across different project modules.

## 🛠️ In Active Development
*   **Enhanced Input System:** Currently implementing modular input mapping for character locomotion and interaction.
*   **Advanced AI:** Developing enemy logic using **Behavior Trees** and Blackboard systems for dynamic navigation.
*   **GAS (Gameplay Ability System):** Ongoing research and initial framework setup for attribute management and ability tags.

## 💻 Tech Stack
*   **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.4+
*   **Language:** Modern C++ (UE5 Coding Standard)
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub Desktop
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
